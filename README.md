# Password-Generator

## Description
For this assignment I was tasked with creating a password generator that creates a password between 8 and 128 characters. This password can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. It is all set to be randomly generated based on the specifications that the user chooses when generating a new password.
